Introduction:
    
    This interactive fiction game is based on the classic Nintendo 64 title 
    "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time," released in 1998.
    
    In this game, players must solve four riddles that will test their wisdom,
    courage, and strength.
    
    By solving the riddles, players will collect the "Triforce of Wisdom", 
    "Triforce of Courage" and "Triforce of Power." These three pieces are 
    crucial in defeating the evil sorcerer Ganondorf, the game's final boss.
    
    The game begins at the Temple of Time, where players start their journey.
    Round 1 is the Riddle of Wisdom, where players must answer riddles to move
    forward. Round 2 is the Trials of Courage, where players must prove their 
    bravery. Round 3 is the Challenge of Power, where players must demonstrate
    their strength.
    
    Once all three rounds are completed, the player will be transported to 
    Ganon's Castle, where they will face the final boss.
    
    This game requires players to have previously played "The Legend of Zelda:
    Ocarina of Time" as the events in this game build upon the original game's
    story. Get ready to put your wit and bravery to the test as you embark on 
    this thrilling adventure.
